# Knowledge Nexus: Your AI-Powered Personal Knowledge Discovery Engine

## üõ† Getting Started

1. install neo4j
2. install python
3. make and configure .env in root directory
4. adjust options in config/config.yaml if necessary
5. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. `python main.py`

## üåü Project Overview

Knowledge Nexus is an advanced personal knowledge management system that transforms the way individuals organize,
process, and discover insights from their digital content. By leveraging the power of AI and graph databases, this
project addresses the challenge of information overload and disconnected data silos that many knowledge workers face in
today's digital landscape.

Unlike traditional note-taking or knowledge management tools that rely heavily on manual organization, Knowledge Nexus
automates the process of extracting key concepts, generating insights, and creating meaningful connections across your
personal knowledge base.

## üéØ Key Challenges Addressed

1. **Information Overload**: Knowledge Nexus cuts through the noise by automatically extracting key entities and
   insights from various content sources, helping you focus on what's important.

2. **Manual Processing Overhead**: Traditional tools require significant manual effort to organize and connect
   information. Knowledge Nexus automates this process, saving you time and cognitive effort.

3. **Limited Contextual Understanding**: While tools like Obsidian or Roam Research rely on explicit links, Knowledge
   Nexus uses AI to understand semantic and topical relationships, creating a richer, more nuanced knowledge graph.

4. **Disconnected Data Silos**: By importing and processing data from various sources into a single, interconnected
   knowledge graph, Knowledge Nexus bridges the gaps between your different information repositories.

5. **Difficulty in Discovering New Connections**: The AI-powered system can uncover non-obvious relationships between
   different pieces of information, potentially leading to new insights or ideas that you might have missed.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Multi-Source Data Integration**: Import content from Notion, Pocket, web pages, and more (extensible architecture
  for adding new sources).
- **AI-Powered Entity and Topic Extraction**: Automatically identify and extract key entities and topics from processed
  content.
- **Intelligent Insight Generation**: Leverage AI to generate concise insights from your personal knowledge base.
- **Semantic Knowledge Graph Construction**: Build a comprehensive, interconnected graph of entities, topics, and
  content using Neo4j, reflecting not just explicit links but semantic relationships.
- **Contextual Querying and Exploration**: Easily retrieve relevant content and explore connections within your
  knowledge graph.
- **Personalized Knowledge Assistant**: Tailored to your specific needs and preferences, helping you find tools,
  frameworks, and best practices aligned with your views.

## üë• Who Is It For?

Knowledge Nexus is primarily designed for individual users who:

- Deal with large amounts of information from various sources
- Seek to uncover new insights and connections within their knowledge base
- Want to reduce the cognitive overhead of manual knowledge management
- Are looking for a personal research assistant to aid in complex tasks or decision-making
